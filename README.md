# Test-email-2020

1- Use the files from the creative folder to develop a NYT email template. The template should render well on mobile and desktop. Links, copy and most images are and can remain placeholders however the layout pictured should be replicated as closely as possible.

2- You can use the reference.html file included as a style guide. Note that the file is not an exact layout match, contains more code than you need and includes bugs so you should not use it as a straight copy. 

3- Please return your .html file to tara.sarath@nytimes.com.
